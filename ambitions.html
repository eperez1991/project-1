<p>Hello, my name is Edwin E Perez. I lived in Puerto Rico my entire life until 4 years ago. I used to go to the University of Puerto Rico and after the first year in Biology I decided to move to the United States. When I moved, I went to Joliet Junior college for my first 2 years and decided to go big. After thinking which university was the best for me I decided to apply to Illinois Institute of Technology. 



<p>My semester at IIT was kind of hard because coming from a Junior College to a university was a big change. I was struggling with English language and  I was trying to fit-in with others. At that time I was taking Java programming language and I realize computer science wasn't for me. I was trying to learn 
one language with the other one in progress. After that first semester I decided to change major and go to ITM. It has been great since that time.  </p>


<p> I have taken some programming classes. I can say that Java and C++ are not my main  strength but I look forward to achieve them. I am very interested in web design and networks. 
I look forward to improve in all my ITM classes.  

<p> Since I was a kid, I always was thinking "BIG". Always knew I wanted to be someone in life. I am in the process of getting to that point, I learned here at IIT that
is not easy but it is achievable. I still don't know what to focus with my ITM major but I want to learn the most I can.</p>
